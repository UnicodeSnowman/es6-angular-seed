### ES6 AngularJS Seed

As of now, this is a pretty incomplete proof of concept. I wanted to get
an uber imple AngularJS app up and running with traceur. Gulp seems to be
way ahead of the game on this (I struggled long and hard to get this working
with Grunt and it never quite worked out). I held out on Gulp for awhile,
as we're pretty deep into Grunt, but I'm actually really digging Gulp.
Seems the Angular team has moved to Gulp for all Angular 2.0 components
as well.

more to come...
